  description: `This project seeks to address an issue still often overlooked in museums: art history is a history of men, written by men, and generally intended for men. However, women, alongside other minorities, have indeed contributed to the production of the most iconic works in the West. It is time to see and hear them.
  
For this first prototype, we focused on a few women who had relationships with the painter Pablo Picasso. Through three of his works, you will encounter Olga Khokhlova, Marie-Thérèse Walter, and Dora Maar. All three were more than just muses passively posing for the painter; they influenced his work. La Fin des Paillassons also invites you to discover how the lives of these three women were marked by their relationship with Picasso.

Thanks to augmented reality, it is possible to give a voice back to these figures, forgotten or distorted by the famous artist.
