  title: 'Début de la visite',
  subtitle: "L'espace des plateformes",
  description_justified: `In these crossroads that are digital platforms, our relationship with audiovisual media is at play today. Transactions take place, opinions aggregate, communities of meaning form and deform, and "conversational practices of the image" (André Gunthert) emerge, scattered in a collective becoming within a polyphonic framework.

Thus, "The abundance that the Internet and digital technology have introduced into the circulation of images means that one no longer has to choose between appropriation and sharing; instead, they merge." (Mona Chollet).

Indeed, it is this tension between appropriation and sharing that is explored here through the notion of platform space. Platforms are not empty shells, simple vehicles for the expression of individuals and communities. They offer us (or impose upon us) markers that contain or propel, in new ways, our modes of consumption and creation.

The space of platforms encourages visitors to explore the creative practices of artists as well as certain specific, intimate uses of contemporary digital platforms. The emphasis is on the political dimension embedded in the concept of space. It allows us to reflect on power dynamics, the persistent inequalities in access and circulation within the digital realm, but also on the harmful effects of our relentless consumption on the planet, as well as the irresponsible race toward short-lived equipment.

This exhibition, stemming from various disciplinary backgrounds, stances, and cultural areas, addresses several aspects of the role that platformized tools have taken in our daily lives. It presents perspectives that shed light on traditional media and their digital shift, on counter-models attempting to oppose the domination of a few economic giants, as well as on the ways fans adapt to these logics and, more broadly, on our relationship with online creation and sharing.
